# Scientific Calculator

This project is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, it contains different math functions one would use to solve advanced Math calculations. 

This project contains different functions and I had to assure the quality of the calculator, so no fails should be present. The tricky part is that some Math calculations can be expressed very different, some people may use parentheses, power, factorial; change signs (positive to negative or viceverse), so I must check many test cases to assure the calculator works as intented.

This is still a work in progress, I'm creating other functions and I can include more in the future, as a 2nd mode (many scientific calculator include it) or adding more rows at the top. 

This is a responsive webapp, using Grid and Flexbox for layout and 'clamp()' functionality for font sizes, it's able to adapt to different screen sizes
