# Scientific Calculator

This project is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, it contains different math functions one would use to solve advanced mathematical calculations. 

This project contains different functions and I had to assure the quality of the calculator, so no failures appeared. Some math calculations can be expressed very different, some people may use parentheses, power, change signs (positive to negative or viceverse), etc; so I must check many test cases to assure the calculator works as intented.

This is still a work in progress, I'm creating other functions and I can include more in the future, as a 2nd mode (similar to physicial scientific calculators) or adding more rows at the top. 

This is a responsive webapp, it uses Grid and Flexbox for layout purposes and 'clamp()' functionality to adjust font sizes so it's able to adapt to different screen sizes
